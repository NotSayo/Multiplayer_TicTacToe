# SignalR - TicTacToe Project

Just a simple school project, made to... I'm gonna be honest here, show our teacher that we can do more than she expects us to do sometimes. *(we were getting bored)*
Don't mind the code, just enjoy that it's working :)
Oh and yes I do realize that there are probably 10000 better ways to do it and that you can easily play as someone else. Ngl, it's your friends trying to screw you over not mine :3.
